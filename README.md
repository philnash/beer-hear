A campaign for better beer at music venues

## What? ##

This is a [London MusicHackDay](http://london.musichackday.org/2013/index.php?page=Main+page) hack built on node.js using the Songkick, Foursquare and Untappd APIs and hosted on Heroku.

It is available at [http://beerhear.philna.sh](http://beerhear.philna.sh), but may not workâ€¦ it is a hack.
